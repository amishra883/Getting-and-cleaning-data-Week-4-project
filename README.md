CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
Use rbind and cbind functions to merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Use select function to extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Use gsub function to appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
